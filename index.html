          <h2>DJ Khaled's fly on the wall</h2>
          <p>Getting the point across, that's what a good portfolio is all about. Taking the right shot isn't always an easy task for Ivan. When your working with big name artists such as DJ Khaled, Justin Beiber, P Diddy, and Migos to name few; you must execute quality of the highest degree. I wanted to portray Ivan's work to resemble a digital art gallery to give each photo the space it deserved. This site was built using Worpress and the theme 'semplice'.</p>

          <h2>QC The Label</h2>
          <p>This is a project I made based off of my love for hip hop and great design. The record label “Quality Control” has a not so great site I found out and so I wanted to re-design it with a cover slider displaying their latest releases and a side bar navigation. This design is also responsive that deploys a mobile navigation with hamburger menu once the screen size is minimized. HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery were used to stitch this together.</p>

          <h2>Nordstrom Department Store</h2>
          <p>This app is perfect, well almost perfect. Nordstrom has done an amazing job with their app, salute to the current development team there sticking to the minimalistic style cues. Improvements can be made though and in this outlined case study I flesh out some of those ideas. These revisions include a return appointments scheduler within the app, a restaurant location finder within certain Nordstrom locations, and a membership tags generator for app users.</p>

      <p>I'm a Graphic Designer and self taught Web Developer currently looking for work. If you've got a business or project idea in your heart, attack it until you can't breath any longer. I'm an expert in Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, and Sketch. I'm proficient in turning any mock-up in to HTML & CSS, SASS, and implementing JQuery for functions or animations when necessary. I’m currently learning Vanilla Javascript though to have a better foundational understanding of how these different JS frameworks function. If you have a proposal or inquiry, please don't hesitate to contact me. I want to add value to your business or project as much as possible. Broward County has taught me everything I know. I'm a Big Dog lover, Political Junkie, Gary Vee fan, and FC Barcelona loyalist. Força Barça.</p>
